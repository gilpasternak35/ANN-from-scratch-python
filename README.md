# ANN-from-scratch-python
A one week hackathon project, mathed whiteboarded and derived entirely from sractch. Partner coded with @gilpasternak35. Extensible design, best implementation practices and comprehensible test coverage. 
Features include: Cached Recursive backpropogation, Synthetic data testing, intuitive api, object oreinted design and comprehensive input validation. All computations done across all training examples simultaneously. 
Next steps include addition of batching, dropout and extension to an RNN
