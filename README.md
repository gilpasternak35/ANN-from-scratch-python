# ANN-from-scratch-python

A one week hackathon project, mathed, whiteboarded, and derived entirely from scratch. Partner coded by @limpa105 and @gilpasternak35. Extensible design, best implementation practices and comprehensible test coverage. 

**Features include**: 
* Cached Recursive backpropogation
* Synthetic data testing
* Intuitive API
* Object oriented design
* Comprehensive input validation. 

All computations done across all training examples simultaneously. 

## Next steps:
* Addition of batching
* Dropout 
* Extension to an RNN
